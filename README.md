# Statistical Approach to Candlestick Patterns

## Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for detecting and visualizing various candlestick patterns in stock market data. It's part of a larger project exploring the statistical significance of various candlestick patterns in technical analysis.

## Why This Project?

Candlestick patterns are widely used in technical analysis, but their effectiveness is often debated. This project aims to:

1. Provide a robust method for programmatically detecting any candlestick pattern
2. Visualize these patterns across long-term stock data
3. Statistical analyze the results of these patterns 


## File Structure

- `patterns.py`: Contains functions for programmatically define various candlestick patterns
- `loader.py`: Utilities for loading and preprocessing stock data
- `plots.py`: Functions for creating interactive visualizations
- `analysis.py`: Functions for statistical analysis of pattern returns
- `Pattern_Medium_01.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showcasing the code journey related to the Medium publications

## Future Work

This repository is part of an ongoing project. Future updates will include:
- Further Statistical analysis of pattern performance
- Comparative analysis across different stocks and different patterns
